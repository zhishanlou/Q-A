#Some feelings about the task

-First, the most difficult thing I had ever met is that I must find the right methods in many possible ways. As a result, a lot of time was spent reading and searching, which was really awful and inefficient. But I continued and did my best for the task.<br>

-Second, it was a pity that I had a busy week with students' jobs, and other tasks. Though I hadn't had enough time to arrange my web task perfectly, I still did it and try to finish it.<br>

-Last, I also learned that good work needs time and practice. And I sincerely appreciate QSC for giving me such a good chance to know things about front-end development, which had a deep impression on me.<br>
